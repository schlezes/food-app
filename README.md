# food-app

This is the first upload of a vue application.

The project is for a food app in cell phone.


![opening page](https://github.com/schlezes/food-app/blob/master/page.png)

This app runs on a click to anyone of the 12 food items in the table.

The food item is an ul-li pair and the li text content is the food item.

The resulting click will display a listing of the food objects and will render a message above in the Food Group Selections div element.

The logic is an if, else if and else condition on the click event and as a result only two clicks are allowed on the table.

Subsequent clicks can be made on the resulting button list that appears in yellow.

This subsequent list is used for further refinement of the rule set for food combining.

Clicks will change the color of the buttons however will not provide a further refinement message at this juncture.

This is not yet completed as I am designing a new set of rules for individual food items.

It is complicated.

Thanks.
